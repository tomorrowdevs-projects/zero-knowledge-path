# TomorrowDevs Zero-knowledge Learning Path

This hereby defined repository contains the learning path for **TomorrowDevs** students to learn the basics on how a computer works.

The purpose of the learning path, _which consists of a set of external videos and exercises_, is to provide students with the
basic understanding of how a computer transforms our programming code into CPU-readable code as well as provide a set of logic-based
exercises.

At the end of this path a student should be able to approach the programming basics path.
